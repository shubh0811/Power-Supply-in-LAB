# Power-Supply-in-LAB

#### Hi,
 #### Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project  that i made.

 ##### Here is the schematic on which i worked. It clearly shows that the transformer is connected to the diodes and the Load.

   #### Now in this image we could see the actuall connection. The transformer is of 6v and 500ma (6-0-6v). 
   #### Transformer is connected so that we could step down the voltage coming from the main supply, the output of transformer will be 6v.
   #### Transformer passes the voltage to the diode so that it converts AC to DC. Then comes the resistor or load  for the output.

#### According to this image, I took 2 wires and and first connected it to the multimeter for checking the output. 
####  After that i connected it to the DSO . As shown in the DSO i got DC as the output
#### although DC was not pure, which means compared to the battery it was'nt direct. Check the next image now.

.

 #### Now i added a Capacitor in the connection which is connected parallel to the resistor(i have'nt shown the capacitor in the schematic so, capacitor 
  #### is connected parallel to the resistane or load and its value is - 1000uf,45v)
 #### Now if we check our DSO we could se we are getting pulsatic output, which means the output is almost pure.
 #### How this happened, Capacitor's nature is to charge and discharge so as capacitor gets the input it charges but during discharging being of high value(1000uf)
 #### it takes miniseconds to discharge and starts charging again. This is why the curve in the DSO is approx straight but not full straight because of the time spent in discharging.
