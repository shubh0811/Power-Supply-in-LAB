# Power-Supply-in-LAB

##### Hi,
 ##### Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project  that i made.

 ##### Here is the schematic on which i worked. It clearly shows that the transformer is connected to the diodes and the Load.

   #### Now in this image we could see the actuall connection. The transformer is of 6v and 500ma (6-0-6v). 
   #### Transformer is connected so that we could step down the voltage coming from the main supply, the output of transformer will be 6v.
   #### Transformer passes the voltage to the diode so that it converts AC to DC. Then comes the resistor or load  for the output.

#### According to this image, I took 2 wires and and first connected it to the multimeter for checking the output. 
#### The output voltage was near to 6v. After that i connected it to the DSO . As shown in the DSO i got DC as the output
#### although DC was not pure, which means compared to the battery it was'nt continuous. Check the next image now.

.

 #### Now i added a Capacitor in the connection which is connected parallel to the resistor(i have'nt shown the capacitor in the schematic so, capacitor 
 is connected parallel to the resistane or load and its value is - 1000uf,45v)
 Now if we check our DSO we could se we are getting pulsatic output, which means the output is almost pure.
 How this happened, Capacitor's nature is to charge and discharge so as capacitor gets the input it charges but during discharging being of high value(1000uf)
 it takes miniseconds to discharge and starts charging again. This is why the curve in the DSO is approx straight but not full straight because of the time spent in discharging.
